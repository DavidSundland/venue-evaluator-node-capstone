# Venue e-Valuator Capstone
Thinkful Node Capstone

## Background

I built this app because I love live music, and when I am going to a new music venue, I want to be able to find information about the music experience at that venue.  If I am going to a concert in a bar, I want to know what the music experience is like, not how good the food is; if I am going to a concert in a church, I don't need to know how great the sermons are.  This app provides users with information about locations within Washington, DC, which regularly host live music, and allows users to leave music-focused reviews about those locations.
Live preview available soon at: (insert link)

## User Story
This app allows users to quickly get information about venues in Washington, DC, that regularly or periodically offer live music.  Users can search for venues by venue type, size, and/or rating, and/or by the type of crowd vybe.  The app returns a list of venues that meet their criteria; the user can select a venue and get information about that venue, including a photo, map, address, description, and reviews.  User can also post their own review.

As a user, I want to quickly find overviews about music venues in Washington, DC, so that I can determine which venues might be of interest:

The main page:
* User sees a header, a box with search terms, and a results list. The results initially list venues in order of overall ranking (a mix of popularity and user rating).
* User can opt to sort venues by venue type, venue size, user rating, and/or expected crowd type.  Upon submitting a query, the results list updates.
* The results list offers a succinct desription of each venue; user can select any venue in the list for more detailed information.
* When a venue is selected, detailed information about that venue is appended to the bottom of the screen (or replaces a previously-selected venue).

As a user, I want an overview about each venue that interests me so that I can determine if I want to visit that venue, and I want to be able to leave reviews so that I can share my experience with others:
![venue details](https://github.com/DavidSundland/venue-evaluator-node-capstone/blob/master/public/venue_detail_wireframe.jpg?raw=true)
* Detailed information about an individual venue includes the venue name, a link to the venue's website, a photo, a map, a description, and user reviews (if applicable).
* Users can leave their own reviews, including providing ratings in pre-selected categories and a text box in which detailed comments can be written.
