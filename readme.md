# Venue e-Valuator Capstone
Thinkful Node Capstone

## Background

I built this app because I love live music, and when I am going to a new music venue, I want information about that venue that is music-focused, not focused on other aspects of the business or organization - if I am going to a concert in a bar, I want to know what the music experience is like, not how good the food is; if I am going to a concert in a church, I don't need to know how great the sermons are.

Users can search for venues by venue type, size, and/or rating, andor by the type of crowd vybe.  The app returns a list of venues that meet their criteria; the user can select a venue and get information about that venue, including a photo, map, address, description, and reviews.  User can also post their own review.
