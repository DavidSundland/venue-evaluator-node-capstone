In the mid-1940s, the venue changed to a movies-only policy and its owner, Harry Warner, one of the Hollywood’s Warner Brothers, changed the name to the Warner Theatre. The venue declined over time, but was reborn as a concert venue in the mid-1970s. The theatre closed again in 1989 for a 3-year renovation, and was born anew in 1992 as a spectacular, landmark desination for music, theater, and dance.",

It includes DC’s finest jazz artists, who help continue the heritage of classical, straight-ahead jazz. “Blue Monday Blues” was launched in 2006 and happens every Monday evening from 6 to 9 pm. Blue Monday welcomes a great many of the area’s finest electric, down- home artists who offer incredible live performances for a diverse audience of folks from around the D.C. area.",
